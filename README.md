# AprilMilesWedding

This is the website I built for my wedding. It uses Node/Express for the server-sided logic and AngularJS for the front end.

Authentication is implemented using Passport and bcrypt. In order to register, an invitation code is required to prevent random people from rsvping to the wedding.

The datastore is DynamoDb and everything is hosted on AWS.
